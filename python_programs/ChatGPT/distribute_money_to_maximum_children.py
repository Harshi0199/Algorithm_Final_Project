# Problem 2591: Distribute Money to Maximum Children
# Difficulty: Easy
# Description:
# <p>You are given an integer <code>money</code> denoting the amount of money (in dollars) that you have and another integer <code>children</code> denoting the number of children that you must distribute the money to.</p>
# <p>You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:</p>
# <ul>
# 	<li>All money must be distributed.</li>
# 	<li>Everyone must receive at least <code>1</code> dollar.</li>
# 	<li>Nobody receives <code>4</code> dollars.</li>
# </ul>
# <p>Return <em>the <strong>maximum</strong> number of children who may receive <strong>exactly</strong> </em><code>8</code> <em>dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules</em>. If there is no way to distribute the money, return <code>-1</code>.</p>
# <p>&nbsp;</p>
# <p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
# <pre>
# <strong>Input:</strong> money = 20, children = 3
# <strong>Output:</strong> 1
# <strong>Explanation:</strong> 
# The maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:
# - 8 dollars to the first child.
# - 9 dollars to the second child. 
# - 3 dollars to the third child.
# It can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.
# </pre>
# <p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
# <pre>
# <strong>Input:</strong> money = 16, children = 2
# <strong>Output:</strong> 2
# <strong>Explanation:</strong> Each child can be given 8 dollars.
# </pre>
# <p>&nbsp;</p>
# <p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
# <ul>
# 	<li><code>1 &lt;= money &lt;= 200</code></li>
# 	<li><code>2 &lt;= children &lt;= 30</code></li>
# </ul>

class Solution:
    def distMoney(self, money: int, children: int) -> int:
        # It is impossible to distribute money if we don't have at least 1 dollar per child.
        if money < children:
            return -1

        # Give every child 1 dollar. The remaining extra amount.
        extra = money - children

        # Let x be the number of children who receive exactly 8 dollars.
        # Since every child already got 1 dollar, these x children must get an extra 7 dollars each.
        # Thus, a candidate x is feasible only if extra >= 7*x.
        # Moreover, let T = extra - 7*x be the remaining extra dollars to distribute over the other (children - x) kids.
        # These children will end up with 1 + (their extra). We have the constraint that no child can end up with 4 dollars,
        # i.e. no child can get exactly 3 extra dollars.
        #
        # For groups of children where (children - x) >= 2, we can always partition T (â‰¥ 0) among them
        # in such a way to avoid any one child receiving exactly 3 extra dollars.
        # The only delicate case is when there is exactly one remaining child (children - x == 1).
        # In that case the single child would have to receive all of T. If T equals 3 then that child's total becomes 4,
        # which is forbidden.
        #
        # Also, when x == children (i.e. everyone gets exactly 8 dollars) then the leftover T must be 0.

        # The maximum potential x (ignoring the leftover partition constraint) is bounded by:
        max_possible = min(children, extra // 7)

        # Try from the maximum candidate x downward until we find one that allows a valid partition of the remaining extra dollars.
        for x in range(max_possible, -1, -1):
            remaining_children = children - x  # children who are NOT getting exactly 8 dollars
            leftover = extra - 7 * x  # remaining extra dollars after giving x children an extra 7 dollars

            if remaining_children == 0:
                # In this case all children get exactly 8 dollars,
                # so the leftover extra dollars must be exactly 0.
                if leftover == 0:
                    return x
                else:
                    continue

            if remaining_children == 1:
                # With one child, that child must get all leftover dollars.
                # If leftover equals 3 then that child's total will be 1 + 3 = 4 dollars, which is forbidden.
                if leftover == 3:
                    continue
                else:
                    return x

            # For two or more remaining children, we can always partition leftover among them
            # while ensuring that none of them ends up receiving exactly 3 extra dollars.
            return x

        return -1
